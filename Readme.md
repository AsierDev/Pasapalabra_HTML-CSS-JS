#**Final Project for Skylab Coders bootcamp pre-course**

####***You can try the game here*** *(https://asierdev.github.io/Pasapalabra_HTML-CSS-JS/)*

##***How to play?***

You have 250 seconds to answer every question. If you click the "pasapalabra" button, it will jump that letter and carry on with the next one. After you complete the first round, it will ask you again as many letters as you didn't answer in the previous round until you give an answer.

You can activate the TTS function with the switch. Then all the questions will be read by the browser.

If you run out of time, or if you answer all the questions, the game will end.
